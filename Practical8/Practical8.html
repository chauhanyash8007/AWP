    <!-- Conclusion for Node.js Installation and Package Management In this study, we
    explored the installation of Node.js, verified its setup, and learned how to
    manage packages using npm (Node Package Manager). By understanding how to
    install, update, and remove packages, developers can efficiently manage
    dependencies for their projects. This knowledge is essential for building
